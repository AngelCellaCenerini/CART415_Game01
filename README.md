Windows & MAC Builds
### Post-Playtest Questions
#### (I thrive on feedback, so no need to sugar-coat üßÇ‚ú®)
- Please describe/narrate your experience: who do you play as? What do you do? What happens around you? (no need to stick to my presentations - ignore those altogether actually, just tell me what story you ended up playing ‚ù§Ô∏è)
- What was your objective, if you identified any? If so, how soon did you identify it/them?
- The UI is presently bare-bones, however the steps are there; how guided did the experience feel?
- How were you challenged by the prototype, if at all?
- Please identify the most frustating moments experienced while playtesting.
- Please identify moments during playtesting where you felt particularly lost/disconnected from the prototype.
- What is something you wished was implemented? Something that _feels_ it needs to be there but isn't?

### Known Issues/Bugs
- Camera becoming problematic in 2nd room especially;
- Character being upside-down (pls ignore that one);
- Weird colliders on the room itself - player can walk off-map;

### WIP/Missing Implementations
- Barely-there UI;
- No textures;
- No sound;
- No animations
- Missing 'video' footage on screen (supposed to display while 'Alert' message is there)
- Ingredients not being specified but listed/numbered as 'Ingredient[index]';
